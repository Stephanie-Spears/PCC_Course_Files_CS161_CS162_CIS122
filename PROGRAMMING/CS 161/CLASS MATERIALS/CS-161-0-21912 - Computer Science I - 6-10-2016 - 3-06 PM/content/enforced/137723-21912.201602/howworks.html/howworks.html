<p>The format for this class is fairly simple and straight-forward.  We will cover the first 10 chapters of the text at a pace of one chapter per week.  The only exceptions to this are that we will not cover a chapter during the week of the midterm and we will cover two chapters in the first week.</p>
<p>Each week there will be the ppt files for the chapter along with notes that I have created to go along with the slides.  As a student you will be responsible for reading through the chapter, viewing the slides, and reading my notes.</p>
<p>Most weeks will also have a programming assignment.  There are a total of 9 programming assignments for this class.  Be sure to pay attention to the due date for the assignments.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable resources available to you as a distance learner is the discussion board.  You should read this frequently and post any time you have questions.</p>
<p>I will be monitoring the discussion board and checking email regularly so that I can respond if there are any questions.</p>
