<h4>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h4>
<p>Computer Science I Introduces control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers. Concepts of data representation and algorithm design; sorting and searching; lab exercises.</p>
<h4>LAB</h4>
<p>There is a non-optional "lab" with this class. In this lab time we will do some hands-on exercises that are intended to reinforce the concepts that you have been learning in class. If you complete the lab exercises early then you can leave the lab time early. If you have any questions or concerns about the lab or the lab schedule please contact me. Instructions on logging into the lab will be posted on D2L before the first session.</p>
<p>Online labs grading is participation based. It is not necessary for you to get every program in the labs working 100% correclty to get full credit for the lab. Each lab is worth 2 points. The points are awarded as follows (they are cummulative up to the max -- 2 points):</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the programming assignment with 100% functionality before the end of lab time -- 2 points.</li>
<li>Login to the online chat session during lab time and post at least one statment - 1 points</li>
<li>Turn in the programming assignment with partial functionality before the end of lab time -- 1 point</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h4>HOMEWORK</h4>
<p>There will be several programming assignments during the course. Some of the assignments will require only a few hours to complete but some will require significant time. Do not wait until the last minute to start the assignments.</p>
<h4>EXAMS</h4>
<p>There are two exams in this class: midterm and final.</p>
<h4>GRADING</h4>
<p>Students will be evaluated based on their performance on exams and programming assignments.</p>
<p>Homework 50%<br /> Online Labs 10%<br /> Midterm 20% <br /> Final 20%</p>
<p>90 - 100% = A <br /> 80 - 89% = B <br /> 70 - 79% = C <br /> 60 - 69% = D <br /> 0 - 59% = F</p>
