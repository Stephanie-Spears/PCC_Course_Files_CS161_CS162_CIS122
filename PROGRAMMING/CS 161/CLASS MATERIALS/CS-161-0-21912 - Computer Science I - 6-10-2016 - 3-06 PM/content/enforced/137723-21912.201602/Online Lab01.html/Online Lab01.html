<p>-- Lab01</p>
<p>This is the first lab for cs161. The objective of this lab is to<br />compile a simple program using the commnand line. In order to do this<br />we'll need to learn how to copy files, compile, and run. Specifically<br />we will learn:</p>
<p>- how to copy lab files<br />- how to read lab instructions<br />- how to compile a program<br />- how to run a program</p>
<p>-- Logging in</p>
<p>Use putty, as described in the introduction lesson, to login. Once<br />you are logged in change your current directory to the "labs"<br />directory (Hint: "cd labs"). If you followed the instructions for the<br />introduction lab correctly you should have a directory here called<br />"lab01". Go ahead and change to that directory (Hint: "cd lab01").</p>
<p>-- Copy lab files</p>
<p>Each lab will have a number of lab files from my directory on the<br />server. To start each lab you will copy these files into your own<br />lab# directory. For lab01 type this command:</p>
<p>"cp ~mike.noel/onlinelabs/cs161/lab01/* ."</p>
<p>You must type this carefully. Pay close attention to the<br />punctuation. If you do this successfully then you will end up with<br />some new files in the lab01 directory. You can see this by listing<br />the files (Hint: "ls"). You may have noticed an error about omitting<br />a directory. Ignore that.</p>
<p>-- Reading the lab instructions</p>
<p>All of the labs include instructions in the lab files. This will<br />always be in a file called "readme". You can view the contents of<br />this file by typing "more readme". Use the space bar to move forward<br />pages. Type "q" to quit. From this point on all lab instructions<br />will be found in the readme for that lab.</p>
