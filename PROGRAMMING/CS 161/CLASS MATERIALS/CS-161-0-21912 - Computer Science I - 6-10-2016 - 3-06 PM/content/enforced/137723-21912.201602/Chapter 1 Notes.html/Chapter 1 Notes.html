<p>Introduction<br />------------<br /><br />An essential part of the computer is "software".&nbsp; These are the<br />programs that run on a computer. Programs are written, by people, in a<br />language called a programming language.&nbsp; As we'll see later there have been<br />several different generations of computer programming languages.&nbsp; For<br />this course we'll be learning C++.&nbsp; It is a reasonably high-level<br />language (that is, it is closer to human languages than others).<br /><br />A Brief Overview of the History of Computers<br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />The main thing to take from this section is to get a sense of the<br />history of computing devices.&nbsp; They started a long time ago but only<br />in the last 200 years did any significant progress appear.&nbsp; In the<br />last 40 years a lot has changed.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see what<br />happens 40 years from now!<br /><br />Notice, also, that the first computer programmer was a woman.&nbsp; This<br />seems ironic since the field is now dominated by men (for no good<br />reason, all of the female programmers I know are excellent!).<br /><br />Elements of a Computer System<br />-----------------------------<br /><br />All modern computer systems have the same basic architecture with the<br />same elements.&nbsp; This is what is described in this section. <br /><br />CPU<br />---<br /><br />The CPU is the main brain of the computer.&nbsp; This is where all<br />processing is done.&nbsp; A typical CPU contains a control unit, an<br />arithmetic logic unit, and registers.<br /><br />Main Memory<br />-----------<br /><br />This is where running programs are stored and where they store the<br />data that they are working with.&nbsp; Notice that each memory location has<br />an address and a value.<br /><br />Secondary Storage<br />-----------------<br /><br />This storage is a lot larger than memory (1000x) but is quite a bit<br />slower.&nbsp; Secondary storage is also persistent.&nbsp; When the power is<br />turned off the data is still there.<br /><br />Input/Output Devices<br />--------------------<br /><br />For modern computers these are primarily the keyboard, mouse, and<br />screen. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Language of a Computer<br />--------------------------<br /><br />Inside a computer all data is represented at 0 or 1.&nbsp; This includes<br />every number, bit of text, image, audio, or movie.&nbsp; In the end,<br />everything is reduced to a sequence of 1s and 0s.&nbsp; These binary digits<br />(bit) are organized into groups of 8.&nbsp; Each group of 8 is called a<br />byte.<br /><br />Bytes can be organized into words, double words, blocks, etc.<br /><br />One important way of representing data is the way that text is<br />represented.&nbsp; Each character is given a numeric code.&nbsp; The standard<br />code is what is called ASCII (pronounced askee).&nbsp; For example, the ASCII code for "A" is<br />65.&nbsp; Although ASCII has been the standard for several decades, it is<br />being replaced with Unicode.&nbsp; ASCII can only represent 127 different<br />characters.&nbsp; This is not sufficient for all of the world's languages<br />(not to mention extraterrestial languages!).&nbsp; So the new standard is<br />Unicode.&nbsp; This will allow representation for tens of thousands of<br />characters and symbols.<br /><br />We will only be dealing with ASCII in this class.<br /><br />The Evolution of Programming Languages<br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Since everything is stored as bits, that is all that the CPU can deal<br />with.&nbsp; So any program has to be a sequence of 1s and 0s.&nbsp; That would<br />be very tedious for programming.&nbsp; For example, what does this program<br />do?<br /><br />110101101101111000101011011110101101101111000101011011<br />111011011001111000010110111101111011011010011010110011<br />101011110011111001010110101101011110011110100010111110<br />111110101010110100101001111110110111100101100101110011<br /><br />I have no idea!&nbsp; In fact, it's probably not a valid program.&nbsp; But you<br />get the point.&nbsp; It is a lot nicer to be able to write:<br /><br />wages = rate * hours<br /><br />To calculate the amount that someone earns.&nbsp; That is something that<br />most people can understand.<br /><br />Programming languages started like the binary data shown above and<br />eventually evolved to the high-level languages that we have today.<br />There is still active research going on for programming languages. In<br />fact, you can get a PhD in programming languages if that sort of thing<br />interests you.<br /><br />Since we write programs in higher level languages but the CPU can only<br />deal with binary programs, we have to convert the high-level program<br />into the binary program.&nbsp; This is done using a tool called a<br />compiler.&nbsp; For this class we'll be using Visual Studio 2010 Express<br />(it is free) to compile our C++ programs so that they can run on a<br />Windows machine.<br /><br />Programming with the Problem-Analysis-Coding-Execution Cycle<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Programming is a process of problem solving.&nbsp; This is a key point.&nbsp; It<br />is not just about knowing the C++ programming language.&nbsp; It is about<br />creating solutions to problems.<br /><br />In particular we develop algorithms to solve problems.&nbsp; An algorithm<br />is a sequence of unambiguous steps that solve a problem in a finite<br />amount of time. This might sound fancier than it is.&nbsp; The truth is<br />that we use algorithms in our own lives everyday.&nbsp; For example,<br />suppose you have the problem of getting to work by 6pm tonight.&nbsp; You<br />will come up with a "plan".&nbsp; That plan will be a sequence of steps or<br />tasks.&nbsp; One such sequence might be:<br /><br />1) lookup bus schedule<br />2) select bus route<br />3) go to bus stop at 5:30pm<br />4) ride bus to destination and exit bus at 5:55pm<br />5) walk across the street to my job<br /><br />Those instructions work just fine for a human.&nbsp; Computers are not as<br />smart as humans so they need more detailed instructions, with nothing<br />left for assumptions.<br /><br />Examples<br />--------<br /><br />The five examples in the book are good examples to show how to do<br />problem solving for programming.&nbsp; These examples are not writing<br />actual programs but are just showing how to solve problems.<br /><br />Programming Methodologies<br />-------------------------<br /><br />There are two popular approaches to problem solving with programming:<br />structured design and object oriented design. &nbsp;<br /><br />While these seem to be two different approaches, it is really the case<br />that object oriented programming builds on the principles of<br />structured design.<br /><br />The first ten chapters in this book will focus primarily on a<br />structured design approach.&nbsp; The second half of the book (cs162) will<br />deal with the object oriented approach.</p>
