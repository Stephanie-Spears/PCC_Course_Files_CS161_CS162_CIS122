<p>Overview<br />--------<br /><br />The basic overview of this chapter is to learn how to write a basic<br />C++ program.&nbsp; It is usually best to learn these things by "doing".&nbsp; It<br />is a good idea to walk through each of the examples in careful<br />detail.&nbsp; Once you have learned how to use Visual Studio 2010 Express<br />(see the programming assignment) then you will be able to run these<br />examples on your computer to see how they work.<br /><br />The Basics of a C++ Program<br />---------------------------<br /><br />A C++ program is a collection of subprograms called functions.&nbsp; A<br />subprogram is a small bit of functionality grouped into a single unit.<br /><br />Every C++ must have a function called "main".&nbsp; This is where the<br />execution of the program will start.&nbsp; Take a look at Example 2-1.<br />This is a very basic and simple C++ program (and suspiciously similar<br />to what you need to do for programming assignment #1).<br /><br />The book describes the details of this program.<br /><br />Comments<br />--------<br /><br />Comments are essential to a program.&nbsp; They are plain text statements<br />added to the code to tell the humans (not the computer) what the<br />program is doing.&nbsp; The computer ignores the comments.<br /><br />Good programs have just the right amount of commenting.&nbsp; Having too<br />few comments is bad.&nbsp; Having too many is bad.&nbsp; A comment should say<br />something more than what the code already says.&nbsp; For example, consider<br />this line of code and comment:<br /><br />x = 5;&nbsp; // Set x to 5<br /><br />I know you haven't learned the assignment statement yet but it should<br />be clear that "x = 5" is assigning the value 5 to x.&nbsp; There is no need<br />to have a comment saying that.&nbsp; And improved version would be:<br /><br />x = 5; // Set x to 5 since there are 5 student records<br /><br />Note that in this case we _explain_ why we are setting the value to<br />five.<br /><br />Identifiers<br />-----------<br /><br />You will use lots of identifiers in your programs.&nbsp; Using good<br />identifiers is a skill and makes your program much better.&nbsp; Notice<br />that identifiers can contain digits but a digit cannot be the first<br />character in an identifier.<br /><br />Whitespace<br />----------<br /><br />This is the term used to describe spaces, tabs, and newlines.<br />Whitespace is ignored by the computer but it is extremely valuable so<br />that humans can read a program.&nbsp; Consider example 2-1 with all<br />unneccesary whitespace and comments removed:<br /><br />#include&lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main(){cout&lt;&lt;"Welcome to C++ Programming."&lt;&lt;endl;return0;}<br /><br />This is much less readable than the way it is written in the text<br />book.<br /><br />Data Types<br />----------<br /><br />Nearly all programs manipulate data in some way or another.&nbsp; Sometimes<br />it's not obvious that that is what it going on.&nbsp; For example, iTunes<br />plays music.&nbsp; Is it maniuplating data?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; It is not changing the<br />data in the mp3 file but it is reading it, processing it, and then<br />sending it to the headphone jack (overly simplified here). &nbsp;<br /><br />In order to manipulate data C++ requires that the programmer (you)<br />indicate the type of the data that you are working with.&nbsp; Indicating<br />the type limits the values that can be used for that data and defines<br />the operations that can be done on that data.<br /><br />There are three kinds of data types in C++: simple, structured,<br />pointers.&nbsp; We'll only be covering the simple types in this class.<br />Structured data and pointers will be in cs162.<br /><br />Simple Data Types<br />-----------------<br /><br />There are three categories: integral, floating-point, enumeration.<br /><br />The term "floating-point" may be unfamiliar to most of you.&nbsp; This<br />refers to what you probably know as "decimal numbers".&nbsp; That is,<br />numbers with a decimal point in them.&nbsp; 3.14 is a floating-point<br />number. We won't be using enumerations until chapter 8.<br /><br />Become familier with all of the integral and floating-point types<br />described in the book.&nbsp; These are the building blocks for all of the<br />rest of C++ programming.<br /><br />Arithmetic Operators and Operator Precedence<br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />The arithmetic operators are the standard + - * / that you learned in<br />grade school (* is multiplication) plus there is a special operator %<br />called the modulus operator.&nbsp; It is easier to think of this as the<br />"remainder" operator.&nbsp; That is, it is the remainder when you divide<br />two numbers.&nbsp; For example 5 % 2 is 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with<br />a remainder of 1.<br /><br />We don't use the modulus operator much in real life but it is used<br />quite often in programming.&nbsp; If you want to know if a number is even<br />or odd (for alternating row colors in a table, for instance) then you<br />use the modulus operator.&nbsp; If you want to determine if a number is<br />prime (for cryptograph) then you use the modulus operator.&nbsp; It is easy<br />to overlook the modulus operator but don't.<br /><br />Consider the following arithmetic expression.&nbsp; What is the answer?<br /><br />2 + 3 * 4<br /><br />Is the answer 20 or is the answer 14?&nbsp; Remember back to your grade<br />school days.&nbsp; What was the rule?&nbsp; Multiplication and division first,<br />then addition and subtraction.&nbsp; So the correct answer is 14.<br /><br />C++ follows the same rules of operator precedence (which operators go<br />first).&nbsp; It also allows you to use () to override. &nbsp;<br /><br />(2 + 3) * 4 = 20<br /><br />Expressions<br />-----------<br /><br />One common mistake when dealing with arithmetic expressions is to<br />forget that division with integers does not automatically become a<br />floating point number.&nbsp; The answer to 5/2 in C++ is 2.&nbsp; It is NOT<br />2.5.&nbsp; The answer to 5.0/2.0 is 2.5.&nbsp; Notice the difference.&nbsp; In the<br />first case it is only integer division so the answer is an integer.<br />In the second case we're using floating point numbers so the answer is<br />floating point.<br /><br />It is important to understand this and pay close attention to the<br />"Mixed Expressions" section.&nbsp; Not getting this right will result in<br />errors in your programs.<br /><br />The string Type<br />---------------<br /><br />Programs that deal only with numbers can be boring.&nbsp; We like to deal<br />with text too.&nbsp; In C++ text is handled as a sequence of characters.<br />(remember that characters are ASCII value representing characters).&nbsp; A<br />sequence of characters is called a string.<br /><br />Strings are enclosed in double quotes "like this".<br /><br />Input<br />-----<br /><br />In order for the computer to perform calculations it needs data to<br />calculate on.&nbsp; This data needs to be stored in the computer's memory.<br />This is done with variables.&nbsp; A variable _declaration_ declares a new<br />place in memory to hold some data.&nbsp; A variable declaration includes<br />the type of data that is to be stored and the name for that variable.<br /><br />Data is put into variables using the assignment statement.&nbsp; The<br />following example creates an integer variable, named bob, and stores a<br />value in it.<br /><br />int bob;<br />bob = 15;<br /><br />An assignment doesn't have to be a simple number.&nbsp; It can be an<br />arithmetic expression:<br /><br />int joe;<br />joe = 15 * 5;<br /><br />It can also use other variables:<br /><br />int sue;<br />sue = joe + bob;<br /><br />Input Statement<br />---------------<br /><br />Usually you want to read data into a variable.&nbsp; The way to do this in<br />C++ is to use the read operator.&nbsp; That operation is &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; Consider this<br />example:<br /><br />int x;<br />cin &gt;&gt; c;<br /><br />This will declare a new variable called x and then read input from the<br />keyboard.&nbsp; The value entered will be stored in the variable x.<br /><br />Increment and Decrement Operators<br />---------------------------------<br /><br />Two handy operators are the ++ and -- operators.&nbsp; These will<br />automatically increment or decrement the variable they are attached<br />to.&nbsp; Notice that there are two types: pre-increment and<br />post-increment. &nbsp;<br /><br />Output<br />------<br /><br />Output to the screen is done using the output operator &lt;&lt;. Study the<br />examples to see the various ways this can be used.<br /><br />Preprocessor Directives<br />-----------------------<br /><br />In this section it is important to notice the use of the namespace std<br />and how to include the string file.&nbsp; Failing to do these two things<br />will lead to unusual problems in your program.<br /><br />Program Style and Form<br />----------------------<br /><br />Up till now the book has been showing you lots of examples.&nbsp; In this<br />final section the specifics of the language are spelled out.&nbsp; This is<br />an important section to be sure to understand it.</p>
