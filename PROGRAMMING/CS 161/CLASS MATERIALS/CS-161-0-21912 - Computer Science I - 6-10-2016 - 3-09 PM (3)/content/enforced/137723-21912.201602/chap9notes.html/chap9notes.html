<p>Overview<br />--------<br /><br />This chapter covers a major new topis: arrays.<br /><br />Arrays are the first "structured data type" that we are covering.&nbsp; We<br />will not focus so much on two dimensional or multidimensional arrays<br />because they are of limited general purpose use and the concepts of<br />single dimensional arrays are easily extrapolated to them.<br /><br />Arrays<br />------<br /><br />The example on page 470 (print numbers in reverse) is a good way to<br />illustrate the value of arrays.&nbsp; In particular, after reading through<br />the code on page 470, try to think about how this would work if you<br />now needed to do the same thing for 100 numbers.&nbsp; Even if you managed<br />to do that, what about 100,000 numbers?&nbsp; Or an undefined number of<br />numbers?<br /><br />At some point you should be thinking "there must be an easier way".<br />There is.&nbsp; Arrays.<br /><br />An array is a collection of a fixed number of elements, all the same<br />type.&nbsp; For example, a list of 100 numbers.&nbsp; There are several aspects<br />to arrays:<br /><br />- declaring array variables<br />- accessing array variables (read and write)<br />- iterating over an array<br /><br />We'll look at each one of these.<br /><br />Declaring arrays<br />----------------<br /><br />You declare an array variable just like declaring a non-array variable<br />but with a tiny bit of added syntax.&nbsp; The following declares an<br />integer variable (non-array):<br /><br />int x;<br /><br />The following declares and array of 100 integer variables:<br /><br />int x[100];<br /><br />Notice the [] and the number of elements.&nbsp; The type can be any type.<br />It is not limited to integers. &nbsp;<br /><br />Accessing array variables (read and write)<br />------------------------------------------<br /><br />Accessing array elements in an array variable is done using the<br />subscript operator [].&nbsp; You specify the name of the array and the<br />element you want:<br /><br />x[5];<br /><br />NOTE: ARRAYS ALWAYS START AT LOCATION 0!!!!!!<br /><br />You can use array subscript access for reading or writing an array<br />value:<br /><br />if (x[5] == 10) {<br />&nbsp; x[5] = 25;<br />}<br /><br />You can also use a variable as a subscript index:<br /><br />int position = 5;<br />if (x[position] == 10) {<br />&nbsp; x[position] = 25;<br />}<br /><br />Iterating over an array<br />-----------------------<br /><br />A very common activity to perform is going through all of the elements<br />of an array.&nbsp; This is frequently done with a for loop.&nbsp; The following<br />goes through the elements of an integer array and sets each value to<br />17;<br /><br />int x[100];<br />for (int i=0;i&lt;100;i++) {<br />&nbsp; x[i] = 17;<br />}<br /><br />Loops for proccessing arrays are very very very common. Review the<br />examples in the book example 9-3 and make sure you understand them.<br /><br />Array sizes<br />-----------<br /><br />The size of an array must be known when the array is declared.&nbsp; C++<br />doesn't support dynamically sized arrays.&nbsp; The following code will NOT<br />work:<br /><br />int size;<br />cin &gt;&gt; size;<br />int arr[size];<br /><br />You have to use a real number for the size.&nbsp; However, it is strongly<br />recommended that you use a constant:<br /><br />const int SIZE = 100;<br />int arr[SIZE];<br /><br />This is helpful because you can now write your for loop like this:<br /><br />for (int i=0;i&lt;SIZE;i++) ....<br /><br />If you ever need to change the size, you just have to do it in one<br />place.<br /><br />Array Index Out of Bounds<br />-------------------------<br /><br />Since an array has a given size there are limits to the valid index<br />values.&nbsp; Negative index values are not allowed.&nbsp; Also, you can't<br />request an index value beyond the size of the array:<br /><br />int x[10];<br />x[15] = 66;&nbsp; // This fails because the valid index values are 0-9.<br /><br />NOTE: C++ will not automatically detect that you write out of bounds.<br />Instead, you will just corrupt a part of your program and cause a<br />crash.<br /><br />Copying arrays<br />--------------<br /><br />You cannot do the following:<br /><br />int x[10];<br />int y[10];<br /><br />x = y;<br /><br />In order to copy one array to the other you have to use a for loop<br />(like above) to do the copying.<br /><br />Arrays As Parameters<br />--------------------<br /><br />You can pass array values as parameters to a function.&nbsp; However,<br />arrays are ALWAYS passed by reference.&nbsp; You do not include the &amp;<br />character for this.&nbsp; It happens automatically.<br /><br />Base Address of an Array and Array in Computer Memory<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This section is important.&nbsp; It gives a detailed description of how<br />arrays are actually stored and accessed in memory.<br /><br />Arrays As Return Types<br />----------------------<br /><br />Arrays cannot by used as the return type for a function in C++.<br />Sorry.&nbsp; Can't be done.<br /><br />C-strings (Character Arrays)<br />----------------------------<br /><br />This section is also important for understanding the fundamentals<br />about strings in C++.&nbsp; In terms of practical use, the section on<br />"string Type and Input/Output Files" is very important.&nbsp; This shows<br />how to let the user provide a filename for reading/writing files.<br /><br />Parallel Arrays<br />---------------<br /><br />Another common processing process is the use of "parallel" arrays.<br />Two arrays are considered "parallel" if they hold related<br />information.&nbsp; For example, if you want to record a person's height as<br />feet and inches you need two variables:<br /><br />int feet;<br />int inches;<br /><br />If you want an array to hold this info you need two arrays:<br /><br />int feet[100];<br />int inches[100];<br /><br />The data in these arrays is clearly related. That makes these parallel<br />arrays.<br /><br />Processing parallel arrays can be tedious and error prone.&nbsp; The index<br />values must be kept in sync between the two.&nbsp; For now this is the best<br />we can do but in cs162 you will learn about structures and that will<br />allow you to avoid parallel arrays.<br /><br />Two- and Multidimensional Arrays<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />This section is interesting but it is not essential.</p>
