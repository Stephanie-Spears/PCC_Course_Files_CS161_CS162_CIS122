<p>Overview<br />--------<br /><br />The focus of this chapter is on input and output.&nbsp; We will focus<br />mostly on keyboard and script I/O but we will also look at file based<br />I/O.<br /><br />I/O Streams and Standard I/O Devices<br />------------------------------------<br /><br />This sections focuses on the extraction operator (&gt;&gt;).&nbsp; Input in C++<br />can be tricky so it is important to clearly understand what is going<br />on in these examples.<br /><br />A key point is that the &gt;&gt; operator will read what it can and then<br />leave the rest for the next operation.&nbsp; For example consider the<br />following code:<br /><br />char ch;<br />cin &gt;&gt; ch;<br /><br />With the input 25.&nbsp; When the first character, 2, is read in, that is a<br />single character so it is stored in the ch variable.&nbsp; But the "5" is<br />left over for the next operation. &nbsp;<br /><br />Look closely at all of the statements in example 3-1 and make sure you<br />understand the results.<br /><br />Predefined Functions<br />--------------------<br /><br />The key point here is that in order to use a predefined function you<br />have to know the header file to include.&nbsp; Example 3-2 shows the use of<br />the cmath and string header files. &nbsp;<br /><br />The get(), ignore(), putback() and peek() Functions<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />These functions are useful for some input tasks but usually the &gt;&gt;<br />operator will be sufficient.&nbsp; Of these four functions the get() is the<br />most useful.&nbsp; It allows you to read in whitespace.&nbsp; Remember that the<br />&gt;&gt; operator skips over whitespace.<br /><br />The dot Operator<br />----------------<br /><br />The book shows the use of the dot operator for the get() (and other)<br />functions.&nbsp; It is important to have the dot there.&nbsp; This pattern will<br />appear in lots of situations.&nbsp; If you find yourself getting strange<br />errors about "cinget()" not found, then check to make sure that you<br />have "cin.get()".<br /><br />Input Failure<br />-------------<br /><br />Input failures happen when the extraction operator (&gt;&gt;) is unable to<br />read valid data.&nbsp; For example:<br /><br />int a;<br />cin &gt;&gt; a;<br /><br />with an input of "W".&nbsp; In this case since "a" is an integer, the<br />extraction operator can't put a "W" in a.&nbsp; It needs a number. Notice<br />the book example with 67.93. <br /><br />When there is an input failure the program doesn't crash.&nbsp; It just<br />continues without changing the data in the variables.&nbsp; This is usually<br />bad. One way to help deal with this is to clear the input.&nbsp; Notice<br />example 3-7 and how the clear() function is used to get input into a<br />good state so that the program can continue.<br /><br />Output and Formatting Output<br />----------------------------<br /><br />Generating output that looks good is a primary focus when writing a<br />program.&nbsp; This section discusses several "manipulators" that will help<br />format output correctly.<br /><br />Notice that you have to include iomanip in order to use these I/O<br />manipulators.<br /><br />setprecision<br />------------<br /><br />This manipulator is used to indicate the number of digits to print<br />after a decimal point. &nbsp;<br /><br />fixed<br />-----<br /><br />Use this to switch from scientific to fixed point display.&nbsp; Use the<br />scientific manipulator to switch back.<br /><br />showpoint<br />---------<br /><br />This manipulator tells the output operator to include the decimal<br />point even if the part after the point is 0.<br /><br />setw<br />----<br /><br />This is one of the most useful manipulators.&nbsp; It is used to set the<br />width of the output of the next expression.<br /><br />setfill<br />-------<br /><br />Use this to fill the blanks from setw() with something other than<br />space characters.<br /><br />left and right<br />--------------<br /><br />The left and right manipulators change the alignment of the ouput.<br /><br />Input/Output and the string Type<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />You can use the &gt;&gt; operator with strings but remember that the &gt;&gt;<br />operator skips whitespace.&nbsp; If you want to read a string value that<br />has spaces in it you need to use getline().&nbsp; The syntax for getline()<br />doesn't use the dot notation.&nbsp; See the examples in the book.<br /><br />File Input/Output<br />-----------------<br /><br />File I/O is a critical thing to understand since nearly all programs<br />(other than these simple ones for class) will use files.&nbsp; Fortunately<br />it's not very hard.&nbsp; The book breaks this down into five steps.&nbsp; The<br />current assignment doesn't require any file reading/writing but future<br />assignments will.</p>
