<p>Overview<br />--------<br /><br />This chapter covers three main topics: enumerations, namespaces, and<br />strings.&nbsp; If you remember, we first mentioned enumerations back in<br />chapter 2.&nbsp; You've been using namespaces and strings already but now<br />you will learn more details about them.<br /><br />Enumeration Type<br />----------------<br /><br />One of the things you should be noticing by now is that it is not<br />simply "good enough" to have a program that can run and do what it's<br />supposed to do.&nbsp; You also should pay attention to how well it is<br />written.<br /><br />Enumerations help considerably in this regard.&nbsp; Consider the following<br />code snippet:<br /><br />cin &gt;&gt; x;<br />if (x == 1) {<br />&nbsp; price = 1.50;<br />}<br />if (x == 2) {<br />&nbsp; price = 1.75;<br />}<br />if (x == 3) {<br />&nbsp; price 2.25;<br />}<br /><br />It's not real clear what is going on there.&nbsp; Obviously price is being<br />set based on different values of x, but what is x?&nbsp; Now look at this<br />bit of code:<br /><br />cin &gt;&gt; size;<br />if (size == DRINK_SMALL) {<br />&nbsp; price = 1.50;<br />}<br />if (size == DRINK_MEDIUM) {<br />&nbsp; price = 1.75;<br />}<br />if (size == DRINK_LARGE) {<br />&nbsp; price 2.25;<br />}<br /><br />This is much clearer.&nbsp; The program is setting price based on the size<br />of a drink.<br /><br />This is one of the main values of enumerations in C++. &nbsp;<br /><br />Read through the sections on enumerations in the book.&nbsp; When it makes<br />sense you should try to use enumerations in your programming<br />assignments.<br /><br />Namespaces<br />----------<br /><br />All of your programs have included the line:<br /><br />using namespace std;<br /><br />The namespace sections in the book provide more details on this.<br />Beyond "using namespace std;" you will not have a need to do much with<br />namespaces for a while.&nbsp; But it is good to know about them.<br /><br />String type<br />-----------<br /><br />You always hear your parents or grandparents complain about how much<br />easier everything is today compared to the "old days".&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Well<br />the "string" type is like that.&nbsp; For close to 10 years C++ didn't have<br />a standard string type.&nbsp; There were several proprietary versions of<br />the string type but no standardized one.&nbsp; Fortunately for you (and<br />everyone) there is now a standard type.<br /><br />The book discusses a few key points with strings:<br />- how to use [] with strings<br />- the length/size function<br />- the fund function<br />- the substr function<br />- the swap function<br /><br />These are all very useful functions that you should understand.&nbsp; You<br />may find it interesting to view the additional functions in Appendix<br />F.</p>
