<p>Overview<br />--------<br /><br />The last chapter introduced the control structures used for selection.<br />This week we will look at the control structures used for<br />repetition. Just like the "if" statement used boolean expressions to<br />make decisions, the repetition (or looping) structures will use<br />expressions to control the loops.<br /><br />There are three main looping constructs: while, for, do...while.<br /><br />while Looping Structure<br />-----------------------<br /><br />A while loop consists of an expression (or condition) and then the<br />statements that are controlled by the expression.&nbsp; Consider this:<br /><br />int i=0;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // line 1<br />while (i&lt;=20) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // line 2<br />&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // line 3<br />&nbsp; i = i + 5;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // line 4<br />}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // line 5<br /><br />The condition is "i&lt;=20".&nbsp; As long as that condition is true, the loop<br />body will run.&nbsp; Let's look at this loop step by step.<br /><br />In line 1 we set the variable i to 0.<br /><br />In line 2 we evaluate the expression "i&lt;=20".&nbsp; Since i is 0 and 0 &lt;<br />20, the expression is true.&nbsp; So we will run one iteration of the<br />loop. &nbsp;<br /><br />Line 3 will print out "0".<br /><br />Line 4 will add 5 to i so the new value of i is 5.<br /><br />Line 5 is the end of the loop body so we go back to evaluate the<br />condition in line 2.&nbsp; Since i is now 5 and is still &lt;= 20 we do the<br />loop body again.<br /><br />Line 3 will print out "5".<br /><br />Line 4 will add 5 to i so the new value of i is 10.<br /><br />Line 5 is the end of the loop body so we go back to evaluate the<br />condition in line 2.&nbsp; Since i is now 10 and is still &lt;= 20 we do the<br />loop body again.<br /><br />Line 3 will print out "10".<br /><br />Line 4 will add 5 to i so the new value of i is 15.<br /><br />Line 5 is the end of the loop body so we go back to evaluate the<br />condition in line 2.&nbsp; Since i is now 15 and is still &lt;= 20 we do the<br />loop body again.<br /><br />Line 3 will print out "15".<br /><br />Line 4 will add 5 to i so the new value of i is 20.<br /><br />Line 5 is the end of the loop body so we go back to evaluate the<br />condition in line 2.&nbsp; Since i is now 20 and is still &lt;= 20 we do the<br />loop body again.<br /><br />Line 3 will print out "20".<br /><br />Line 4 will add 5 to i so the new value of i is 25.<br /><br />Line 5 is the end of the loop body so we go back to evaluate the<br />condition in line 2.&nbsp; Since i is now 25, it is &gt; 20 so we end the loop.<br /><br />Types of while Loops<br />--------------------<br /><br />It is useful to understand that there are different 'types' of while<br />loops.&nbsp; From the C++ perspective they are all the same but the<br />difference is in how you think about it and how you use it.<br /><br />The book describes these in detail.&nbsp; Here is a summary:<br /><br />- counter-controlled:&nbsp; these loops have a condition that is based on a<br />&nbsp; variable that increments or decrements.&nbsp; The example above is an<br />&nbsp; example of a counter-controlled loop.&nbsp; With some analysis you can<br />&nbsp; tell how many times the loop will run.<br /><br />- sentinel-controlled: these loops use a "sentinel" value to tell the<br />&nbsp; loop to exit.&nbsp; For example, ask the user to enter data but enter a 0<br />&nbsp; when there is no more data to enter.&nbsp; You usually don't know how<br />&nbsp; many times the loop will run until it is actually running.<br /><br />- flag-controlled: these loops are similar to the sentinel loops but<br />&nbsp; they use a boolean flag in the condition.&nbsp; The flag is set in the<br />&nbsp; loop body based on some event or condition.<br /><br />There are other while loop types explained in the book but these are<br />the major ones.<br /><br />for Looping Structure<br />---------------------<br /><br />The while loop is general enough to do all repetitions but sometimes<br />it is convenient to have specific loop forms.&nbsp; The "for" loop is a<br />form for doing a loop a specific number of times.<br /><br />The examples in the book are very good at explaining these loops. &nbsp;<br /><br />In general, if you want a loop that runs a specific number of times,<br />use a for-loop.&nbsp; If you want a loop that runs an unknown number of<br />times, use a while-loop.<br /><br />do...while Looping Structure<br />----------------------------<br /><br />The do...while loop is similar to the while loop but it checks the<br />condition AFTER the loop body runs.&nbsp; The main affect of this is that<br />the loop body will always run at least once.&nbsp; This is not the case<br />with while or for loops. In those loops it is possible that the<br />condition is false at the beginning of the loop so it won't run at<br />all.<br /><br />Frequency of loops in code<br />--------------------------<br /><br />In my experience of writing software I have found that the while loop<br />is the most common.&nbsp; The second most common is the for loop.<br />do...while is seldom used.&nbsp; Rough guesses put the relative frequencies<br />as follows:<br /><br />while&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;65%<br />for&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;30%<br />do...while&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5%<br /><br />break and continue Statements<br />-----------------------------<br /><br />The break and continue statements are way to alter the standard loop<br />execution. The break statement will immediately exit the loop (without<br />check the condition) and execution will continue after the loop body.<br /><br />The continue statement will immediately stop the current iteration of<br />the loop and will jump to the condition.&nbsp; This will be evaluated and<br />the loop will either continue or exit, depending on the condition.<br /><br />Avoid using break and continue<br />------------------------------<br /><br />Where possible it is best to avoid using the break and continue<br />statements.&nbsp; These statement have their uses but usually they are<br />misused.&nbsp; For best programming practice it is best to avoid them (when<br />possible).<br /><br />Nested Control Structures<br />-------------------------<br /><br />Just like with if statements, loop statements can be nested.&nbsp; This<br />allows you to generate some fairly complex behavior.&nbsp; Nested loops are<br />commonplace in real code so it is worth the effort to go through the<br />examples (5-18 through 5-23) and understand them.</p>
