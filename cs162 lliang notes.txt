Hello Stephanie,

Please remember that final exam is due soon, not the end of the week. Module 10 should tell you the chapters covered.

Let's talk more about pointers this week. Here is a list of things you can think about:

1. what exactly is in an array name like array1 and array2 in the following statement?

int array1[10]; or int * array2 = new int[10];

2. the meaning of the [] and pointer arithmetic

array[3] is equivalent to *(array+3)

3. array of arrays

char ** names;

4. array of linked lists

Node ** arrayOfLinkedLists;

In most of the cases, we don't keep objects in arrays or linked lists, instead we keep pointers to objects:

array of pointers to objects:

Data ** list = new Data*[CAPCITY];

why? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

linked lists of pointers to objects:

struct Node

{

    Data * data;

     Node * next;

};

Node *head, *tail;

Have fun and good luck with your final exam!
